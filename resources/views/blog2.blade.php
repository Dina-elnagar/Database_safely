    <h3>Finding a good driving instructor is invaluable.</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        While it might be tempting to save money and ask a friend or relative to teach you, it could be a false economy.
        An expert will have a much better idea of what’s expected from you in the test, the ability to improve your skills over time, and could save you from heated arguments with your friends and family in the process.
        Also, a fully qualified teacher will have their own car to teach you in which will have dual controls.
        Dual controls are where the instructor has their own clutch and brake pedals in the passenger footwell, and are able to take over or help out with the controls if they feel you need it at any point.    
        The most important thing when picking an instructor is choosing someone who makes you feel comfortable and happy in the driver's seat, remember you may be spending potentially 40 hours in a car together!
        If you do choose a friend or family member they will have to be over the age of 21 and have held a licence for at least three years. Read our full guide on teaching someone to drive.
        How to find a good driving instructor.

    <div class="p2">
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        For most people, starting their driving lessons will be the first time they have been in the driver's seat of a car with other cars on the road too (no Legoland doesn't count!), so it can feel a little daunting.
        But the right instructor will easily guide you through it and will start you off on very quiet roads.
        For the first lesson they will most likely drive you somewhere where they know there won't be too much traffic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>How many lessons does it take to learn to drive?</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: large;">
        The average learner needs 20 hours of practice to pass the driving test, in addition to 45 hours of driving lessons.
        This is only an average though and shouldn't be something you feel you have to compare yourself to.
        Some take fewer and some take longer to feel comfortable and ready to take their test – the important thing is to take the test when you are ready, not being the first one out of your friends to pass.
        Your instructor will let you know when you are ready, but most of the time you will feel it too – when the time comes you can both come to the decision together and then discuss how best to prepare for your test.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Should I take an intensive course?</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: large;">
        Intensive courses (otherwise known as the poorly named 'crash course') will give you the best chance of passing your driving test in the shortest amount of time. 
        These are normally flexible courses of extended one-on-one tuition with the aim of passing you in as little time as possible.
        They typically work to your schedule with an instructor devising a lesson plan or offering you a range of pre-designed plans suited to your budget and availability.
        Find out more about intensive driving courses and whether they're right for you.

    <div class="p3">
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        You can drive immediately after you pass your test, as long as you are correctly insured for the car you want to drive.
        Your learner driver insurance will cease as soon as you have passed, so you’ll need to take out a full annual car insurance policy if you wish to drive away from the test centre. 
        As a first time driver your insurance will likely be quite expensive, Black Box car insurance can help you save money as it rewards safe driving, and can help to bring down your future premiums. Or you might want to consider our temporary car insurance to cover you for borrowing a car. 
        You'll also want complete peace of mind if your vehicle breaks down. Luckily the RAC has a wide range of breakdown cover packages available, which will give you cover at home and at the roadside as standard.
